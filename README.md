# OS Installation Points
Points on intalling OS on laptop or PC.

Pragmatic questions to consider before doing anything dangerous:

1. Do you have a high speed  (write speed > 30MBps) USB3 flash drive?
1. Do you have any bootable Ubuntu Desktop on USB drive? Invariant of which OS you are going to install, you need to have this one always ready and untouched.
1. Do you have Internet connection?
1. Does your live Ubuntu USB drive connect to Internet using your systems Wi-Fi or you should consider using a LAN cable?
1. Is laptop/PC's UEFI/BIOS settings OK? Take a look at Secure Boot and Compatibility Support Module (CSM)
1. Make sure what you are deleting and overwriting.
1. Hate makes waste.
